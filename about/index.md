## Hello

As senior software engineer I have been working in software industry since 2000. I started my career during college developing applications using C and C++. In late 2002, I started using .Net Framework, C#, and ASP.Net. Since then I have been developing variety of software solutions including Enterprise solutions, Data Warehouse applications, CRM applications, OCR applications, Reusable Frameworks, Reusable data structures libraries, Distributed applications, Windows Mobile applications, Governmental Web Gates, Intranet Portals, E-commerce solutions, E-business solutions, Community based Web applications, and SharePoint applications.

As a result of many years of professional work experience at various multinational organizations including Middle Eastern, American, and European; I’ve gained a strong understanding of the different business models and organization cultures.

In the last years I’ve focused my efforts on software design, architecture, and management processes. I experienced different software development lifecycles such as RUP, MSF, and several Agile techniques as (SCRUM, XP, and TDD). Eventually, I became responsible for managing, assisting, and leading professional software development teams as a lead developer to design, architect, develop, test, deploy, and deliver successful software in iterative and contiguous way.
